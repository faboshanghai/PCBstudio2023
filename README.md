# PCB for Designers - 2023

### “Sensing Ecology”: Electronic Circuits and Programming from  Designers to Citizens

### 从设计师到市民，制作和编程电子电路

Learn the basics of electronic circuits design, fabrication and programming to create your own smart device.

Wednesday 8.00 AM and Thursday 13.30 PM -  CLASSROOM Fablab


### Studio Brief

The studio’s design challenge will revolve around the concept of reconnecting or strengthening the bonds between humans and nature.

Students will design devices that amplify humans’ senses or introduce new ones to enhance our connections with nature and natural phenomena.

Within the design challenge, students will learn the basic skills required to design &gt; fabricate &gt;  program an electronic circuit. In this structure, technical instructions will be 3/4 of the class time.



### Why Circuit Design?

* To make the product smart, the designer cannot be dumb.
* A designer with knowledge  makes a  product with intelligence.
* A designer with electronics knowledge asks better questions and better understands answers.
* Electronics have become cheaper and more accessible, we need to know them.



### How?

* Demystify electronics &gt; anyone can learn how it works and make it
* Learn what each component does &gt; design a circuit
* Make a circuit out of raw copper and components \(no pre-made Arduinos\)
* Program your circuit to do something &gt; less than 10 lines of code



### Studio Outcome

The studio is part of NFSC research project, the outcome will help the research of Urban Nature and Ecological Cities, with the design of a device that can collect data and interact with the urban/natural environment, natural phenomena, citizens interactions, environmental data, etc.

The final result is an input and output system with a programmed micro-controller, integrated in a product, an interactive device or the design of an intelligent environment.



### TOPICS

* Citizen science, urban nature, data collection.
* Basic electronic circuits and components theory.
* Electronic circuit design software \(Autodesk Eagle\)
* Circuit board fabrication \(high precision CNC milling\) and SMD soldering
* Input and Output devices and breadboard prototyping
* Embedded programming \(Arduino Software\).
* System integration \(electronics packaging and user interaction\).



### Is this the right Studio for You?

_Yes! If..._


1. You want to learn technical skills that can be helpful for your future practice
2. You want to work on a smaller design challenge with more focus on learning and applying  practical skills.
3. You are comfortable in a teaching environment where you are left free to make mistakes and you have to fix problems by yourself
4. You are comfortable using a mix of “top-down” and “bottom-up” learning approach:  learn a few basic components of the subject and apply them in practical situations to build knowledge step by step.
5. You want to join a small group of digital fabricators and makers that will surely work over time while having a lot of fun

**No technical background is required, the class is open to anyone.**
